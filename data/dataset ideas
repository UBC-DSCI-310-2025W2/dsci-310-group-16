(Fish Dataset)[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bgsx9fjw4d/2]
Description
- Different fish species with their numerical characteristics
- pretty small dataset (~7200 rows) so won't be too computationally expensive
- perhaps we can do a knn since the dataset is manageable
- there is a bit of class imbalance though (ex. lots of Perch)
- CC 4.0 license so we are free to redistribute 

Research Q: what species of fish is this unknown datapoint? have a few test/train datapoints

(Galtons Height dataset)[https://r-packages.io/datasets/GaltonFamilies]
- pretty old but wellknown dataset that predicts height based on family information 
- GPL license --> free to redistribute and use 
- small dataset --> 934 rows and 8 columns so it'll be fast to compute on 

Research Q: What is the predicted height of the observation?
