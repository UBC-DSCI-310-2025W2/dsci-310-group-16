(Fish Dataset)[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bgsx9fjw4d/2]
Description
- Different fish species with their numerical characteristics
- pretty small dataset (~7200 rows) so won't be too computationally expensive
- perhaps we can do a knn since the dataset is manageable
- there is a bit of class imbalance though (ex. lots of Perch)

Possible questions
- what species of fish is this unknown datapoint? have a few test/train datapoints
