# Group 16 - Code of Conduct 

**the instructions - delete afterwards**
At minimum, we believe that a good/effective code of conduct should include:

A Statement on diversity and inclusivity
Details on expected, and unacceptable behaviour
A list of consequences for unacceptable behaviour
A procedure for reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour


## Introduction 

This document aims to define, foster, and uphold a positive environment that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals. While this document is not comprehensive, we hope that it acts as the foundation for establishing standards and behaviours expected from group members. 

## Scope 

The Code of Conduct applies to all members of DSCI 310's Group 16, and is applicable to activities including, but not limited to, in-person interaction, virtual interactions, work produced, and interactions with the larger community. 

## Diversity and Inclusion 

Our priority is to create a supportive learning environment governed by ethics and integrity. We strongly believe that diversity is a strength and that everyone should be included, regardless of background, abilities, or differences. Diversity and inclusion goes beyond just team composition and member demographic. We hope to uphold a culture where members feel comfortable and supported to share their opinions, perspectives, and engage in respectful dialogue while staying mindful of individual differences. 


## Expectations of Behaviour 

#### *Acceptable Behaviours* 

**Respectful Dialogue** - Diverse opinions and perspective help challenge existing ideas and promotes new ways of thinking. Conflicting opinions are inevitable and should be navigated with mutual respect and open-mindedness. Team members have a responsibility to create space for all members to share their ideas and work, and offer constructive well-meaning criticism that aims to improve the quality of the work itself. 

**Timely Communication** - We expect consistent communication between the team, both in-person and virtual. This includes communications about the following:
- regular updates about project status
- questions or concerns pertaining to project parts
- issues and flags that team members should be aware of
- schedule conflicts or upcoming commitments

Messages should be responded to within 24 hours, preferably as soon as possible. Extentuating life circumstances should be communicated within reasonable time 

**Acknowledgement and Attribution** - We expect all work to be properly attributed and credited when appropriate. All external sources should be properly cited, with direct quotes explicitly declared. 

**Quality and Timeliness of Work** - We expect all parts do be completed with care and high degree of quality. This includes taking the reasonable effort to ensure accuracy of work, minimize errors in the work, and adhere to given guidelines and deliverable guidelines. Feedback and constructive criticism should be promptly considered and incorporated when reasonable. 

All deadlines, both external and internal, should be strictly met. If unable to do so, the reason should be communicated to the rest of the team as early as possible.


#### *Unacceptable Behaviours* 

While we do not anticipate unacceptable behaviours, we find it beneficial to outline behaviours that negative affect team performance. 

**Plagiarism** - As members of the academic community, we do not tolerate plagiarism or improper acknowledge of work. We draw upon UBC's definition of plagiarism (ie."submitting or presenting the work of another person as one’s own, without appropriate referencing" (will cite this later - https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/student-conduct-and-discipline/discipline-academic-misconduct/3-academic-misconduct-ubc-students)), applying this definition to the work of ourselves, organizations, and other individuals. 
- Consequence: Any work found to be improperly unattributed will be re-done. If a pattern of academic misconduct is observed, it will be escalated to course staff

**Poor Communication** - This includes not responding to team communications, vague and unhelpful comments, or consistent pattern of last-minute notifications of personal circumstances. 
- Consequence: We hope initial communication issues can be resolved internally be internal team interventions and feedback. Consistent poor communication will be reflected in team feedback and will be escalated if absolutely necessary.

**Disrespectful or Discriminatory Behaviour** - Group 16 has a zero-tolerance policy to harmful or damaging behaviour. 


## Reporting Behaviour 

We hope to create an environment that is understanding and supportive of personal circumstances and growth. Our hope and expectation is that all team issues or conflicts can be resolved internally. All unacceptable behaviours should be flagged to the group as soon as possiblewhere mitigatory actions will be discussed to prevent re-occurence of said behaviour. It is critical that such discussions focus on the behaviours and outcomes of the behaviour pertinent to the project, and does not engage in personal remarks or irrelevant details.
